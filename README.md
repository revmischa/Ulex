# Ulex
Here you can find Ulex, the open source legal system, under git version control.

## What is Ulex?
An open-source legal system for special jurisdictions, online markets, ZEDEs, seasteads, and other startup communities.
It combines tested and trusted rule sets from private and international organizations in a robust but flexible configuration.

Ulex protects personal and property rights with an efficient and fair dispute resolution process, promoting the rule of law.

Ulex is not imposed by any government but instead adopted by the mutual consent of those it governs.
 

## Why Do We Need Ulex?
* Special legal jurisdictions can encourage local growth and inspire wider reforms.
* The rules that govern these zones have to come from somewhere.
* Ulex offers a neutral and international alternative to the legal systems of particular nation states.
* It offers a flag-free set of rules drawn from private, international, and intergovernmental organizations.
* These tested and trusted rule sets embody international best practices and come free of any foreign sovereign's control.


## How Does Ulex Resolve Disputes?
The default procedure for resolving disputes in Ulex has three elements:
1.  Judges:  Each of the opposing parties chooses a judge, and those two judges choose a third.
2.  Remedies:  The judges choose a remedy offered by one of the parties.
3.  Costs:  The losing party pays the winning party's legal costs.
 
Ulex also includes more detailed procedural rules, authored by preeminent nongovernmental organizations.


## Where Does Ulex Get its Substantive Rules?
Most of the substantive rules of Ulex come from select Restatements of the Common Law, Uniform Codes, and Model Rules.

Ulex also includes a few bespoke rules.


## What Ties It All Together?
Ulex's meta rules ensure that all the various parts work together without contradiction and to practical effect.


## What Inspired Ulex?
Ulex follows the lead of open source operating systems like Unix, GNU, and Linux.

Whereas those codes run computers, though, Ulex runs legal systems.

In either case, users can download, use, and modify the rules free of charge.
> Some institutions claim copyrights in some of the rule sets invoked by Ulex.
